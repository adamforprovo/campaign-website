# Issues

Provo is a great place to live. With thoughtful solutions to our city's challenges, we can make it even better.

## Housing and Growth

### Provo should be a city where everyone can find a place to call home.

Housing is a key challenge for Provo. Families are being priced out of homeownership, while students and single renters are filling up homes in family neighborhoods.

**The root cause of our housing problem is scarcity.** To solve it, we need more homes on the market, of all kinds — including rentals and student housing in locations that make sense.

A more abundant housing market helps everyone. When students and working professionals can live closer to where they study and work, it relieves pressure on our neighborhoods and makes it easier for families to buy back in.

### To promote homeownership, we need to address affordability.

Utah was recently ranked the third-least affordable state to buy a home, behind only Hawaii and California. Those states are outliers. We shouldn't be.

**The median sale price for a house in Provo is $700,000.** If we want to keep homeownership within reach for families, we need to lower the barriers to building more affordable homes.

This includes gentle, neighborhood-scale options like small-lot homes, backyard cottages, and townhouses. These offer an entry point into the market and fit naturally into existing communities.

### Growth is coming. We choose whether to guide it.

Provo is an economic hub. We offer education, jobs, recreation, and upward mobility. People are drawn here for these opportunities.

**Utah County is projected to grow by over 160,000 people in the next decade.** If we push this growth outside our city, we could see thousands of new commuters coming to Provo each day for work and school — straining our roads and services without any of the tax revenue that comes from new residents.

By planning new growth around job centers and transit, we can build our tax base while reducing traffic. This means a better quality of life for everyone in Provo.



## Economy and Finance

### Provo needs a strong economy and a sustainable budget.
