Provo is a great place to live — and it can be even better. Let's meet the future with practical, thoughtful solutions to our city's challenges.

## Housing and growth

### Provo should be a city where everyone can find a place to call home.

Housing is a key challenge for Provo. Families are being priced out of homeownership, while students and single renters are increasingly filling homes in family neighborhoods.

**The root cause of our housing problem is scarcity.** To solve it, we need more homes on the market, of all kinds — including rentals and student housing in locations that make sense.

A more abundant housing market helps everyone. When students and working professionals can live closer to where they study and work, it relieves pressure on established neighborhoods and makes it easier for families to buy back in.

### To promote homeownership, we need to address affordability.

Utah was recently ranked the third-least affordable state to buy a home, behind only Hawaii and California. Those states are outliers. We shouldn't be.

**The median sale price for a house in Provo is $700,000.** If we want to keep homeownership within reach for families, we need to lower the barriers to building more affordable options.

This includes gentle, neighborhood-scale housing like small-lot homes, backyard cottages, and townhouses. These offer an entry point into the market and fit naturally into the fabric of our neighborhoods.

### Growth is coming. We choose whether to guide it.

Provo is an economic hub. We offer education, jobs, recreation, and upward mobility. People are drawn to Provo for these opportunities.

**Utah County is projected to grow by over 160,000 people in the next decade.** If we push this growth outside our city, we'll see thousands of new commuters driving into Provo each day for work and school. We'll face increased traffic, pollution, and strain on city services — without the tax revenue that comes from new residents.

By planning new growth around job centers and transit, we can reduce traffic and build up our tax base. This means a wealthier city, less impact on current residents, and a better quality of life for everyone in Provo.



## Economy and finance

### Provo residents deserve to clearly understand how their money is spent.

Right now, Provo’s financial processes are difficult to understand. Citizens deserve straightforward answers. Transparency builds trust, ensures accountability, and helps us avoid unexpected financial crises.

### Solutions:

* Clearly report our budget's bottom line so residents understand the financial health of our city.
* Evaluate subsidies and expenses to determine whether they align with public interests.
* Openly discuss funding gaps so we can plan ahead wisely, instead of dealing with sudden tax hikes.

## Street safety

### Provo’s streets should be safe for everyone, especially children.

Too many of our streets prioritize speed over safety, creating dangerous conditions—especially for children walking or biking to school. Safer streets protect lives, promote community health, and strengthen neighborhoods.

### Solutions:

* Identify key safety hotspots near schools, parks, and the university.
* Invest in affordable traffic-calming measures like painted crosswalks, curb extensions, and bollards.
* Draw on successful, proven street safety improvements from other cities.

## Parks, trails, and outdoor spaces

### Access to the outdoors is essential to Provo’s quality of life.

As Provo grows, we must maintain and improve access to our parks, trails, and outdoor amenities. These spaces promote health, encourage family activities, and protect our unique environment. They are a vital investment in our community’s long-term future.

### Solutions:

* Prioritize maintaining and enhancing the Provo River Trail—one of our most popular and heavily-used outdoor assets.
* Improve connections between neighborhoods and parks to ensure safe, easy, and pleasant access.
* Review zoning and land-use decisions along the Provo River, emphasizing greater public accessibility and recreational opportunities rather than industrial use.
