# Issues

Provo is a great place to live. As we grow, we face important decisions about our future. Let's build a city that works for everyone who lives here.

## Economy and finance

**Provo residents deserve to clearly understand how their money is spent.**

Right now, Provo’s financial processes are difficult to understand. Citizens deserve straightforward answers. Transparency builds trust, ensures accountability, and helps us avoid unexpected financial crises.

**Solutions:**

* Clearly report our budget's bottom line so residents understand the financial health of our city.
* Evaluate subsidies and expenses to determine whether they align with public interests.
* Openly discuss funding gaps so we can plan ahead wisely, instead of dealing with sudden tax hikes.

## Housing

**Provo should be a city where longtime residents, young families, and students can all find a place to call home.**

Our housing crisis is pushing people away. If we don’t thoughtfully plan for growth, we risk becoming a commuter city—bearing the costs of traffic and congestion without the benefits of a thriving local community. Responsible growth keeps neighborhoods strong and ensures a vibrant city.

**Solutions:**

* Allow gentle zoning reforms (backyard cottages, duplexes, townhomes) that fit naturally into existing neighborhoods.
* Streamline the permitting process for neighborhood-scale housing projects.
* Focus higher-density developments near transit hubs to minimize the impact of traffic.

## Street safety

**Provo’s streets should be safe for everyone, especially children.**

Too many of our streets prioritize speed over safety, creating dangerous conditions—especially for children walking or biking to school. Safer streets protect lives, promote community health, and strengthen neighborhoods.

**Solutions:**

* Identify key safety hotspots near schools, parks, and the university.
* Invest in affordable traffic-calming measures like painted crosswalks, curb extensions, and bollards.
* Draw on successful, proven street safety improvements from other cities.

## Parks, trails, and outdoor spaces

**Access to the outdoors is essential to Provo’s quality of life.**

As Provo grows, we must maintain and improve access to our parks, trails, and outdoor amenities. These spaces promote health, encourage family activities, and protect our unique environment. They are a vital investment in our community’s long-term future.

**Solutions:**

* Prioritize maintaining and enhancing the Provo River Trail—one of our most popular and heavily-used outdoor assets.
* Improve connections between neighborhoods and parks to ensure safe, easy, and pleasant access.
* Review zoning and land-use decisions along the Provo River, emphasizing greater public accessibility and recreational opportunities rather than industrial use.
