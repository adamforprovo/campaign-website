Provo is a great place to live. As we grow, we face important decisions about our future. Let's build a Provo where longtime residents, young families, and future generations can all feel at home.

## Financial Transparency

**Provo residents deserve to clearly understand how their money is spent.**

Right now, Provo’s financial processes are difficult to understand. Citizens deserve straightforward answers. Transparency builds trust, ensures fiscal responsibility, and helps us avoid unexpected financial crises.

**Solutions:**
* Clearly report annual budget surpluses or deficits so residents understand the financial health of our city.
* Ensure transfers between city funds are minimized, clearly explained, and justified.
* Proactively discuss infrastructure funding gaps so we can plan for needed work, instead of dealing with sudden rate hikes.

## Housing and Growth

**Provo should be a city where longtime residents, young families, and students can all find a place to call home.**

Our housing crisis is pushing people away. If we don’t thoughtfully plan for growth, we risk becoming a commuter city—bearing the costs of traffic and congestion without receiving the benefits of a thriving local community. Responsible growth keeps neighborhoods strong and ensures a diverse, vibrant city.

**Solutions:**
* Support gentle zoning reforms (backyard cottages, duplexes, townhomes) that fit naturally into existing neighborhoods.
* Streamline the permitting process for neighborhood-scale housing projects to reduce costs and delays.
* Direct higher-density developments towards areas near BYU and transit hubs, to minimize traffic impacts and preserve neighborhood character.

## Safe Streets

**Provo’s streets should be safe for everyone, especially children.**

Too many of our streets prioritize speed over safety, creating dangerous conditions—especially for children walking or biking to school. Safer streets protect lives, promote community health, and strengthen neighborhoods.

**Solutions:**
* Identify key safety hotspots near schools, parks, and the university.
* Invest in affordable traffic-calming measures like painted crosswalks, curb extensions, and bollards.
* Draw on successful, proven street safety improvements from other cities.

## Parks and Outdoor Spaces

**Parks, trails, and outdoor spaces are essential to Provo’s quality of life.**

As Provo grows, we must maintain and improve access to our parks, trails, and outdoor amenities. These spaces promote health, encourage family activities, and protect our unique environment. They are a vital investment in our community’s long-term future.

**Solutions:**
* Prioritize maintaining and enhancing the Provo River Trail—one of our most popular and heavily-used outdoor assets.
* Improve connections between neighborhoods and parks to ensure safe, easy, and pleasant access.
* Review zoning and land-use decisions along the Provo River, emphasizing greater public accessibility and recreational opportunities rather than industrial use.
