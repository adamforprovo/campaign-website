## Hi — I'm Adam.

I’m running for Provo City Council, and I’d love to earn your vote.

Provo has shaped many chapters of my life. I've lived here as a student, a working professional, and now as a husband and father.

Over the past year, I’ve served on Provo’s Planning Commission, helping guide the growth and development of our community.

I’m excited to bring this experience to the Citywide 1 seat on the Provo City Council.

## Provo needs leaders who look forward.

As we navigate the future, we face key decisions about finance, growth, housing, and our quality of life.

Where is Provo headed? How do we keep our budget balanced as costs rise? Can we remain a welcoming and affordable place for families to put down roots?

I believe we can find answers to these questions. I'm eager to share more of my vision with you.

## Provo needs problem-solvers.

Provo residents face real everyday challenges. They deserve leaders willing to take action and solve problems.

This means diving deep, putting in the work, and delivering practical solutions. 

On the Planning Commission, I've tackled tough issues firsthand. As your representative on the City Council, I'll continue going to bat for you on the issues that matter most.

## Provo needs transparency and communication.

Clear communication builds trust. You should know what's happening in your city, how decisions are made, and where your money is spent.

When problems arise, we should address them early and openly. Transparency today means fewer surprises tomorrow.

I'm committed to listening, communicating honestly, and making sure everyone's voice is heard.

## Provo is for everyone.

I love Provo’s ability to bring people together across generations.

Let's build a city that works for all of us — longtime residents, young families, and generations to come.

I’d be honored to earn your vote this November!
