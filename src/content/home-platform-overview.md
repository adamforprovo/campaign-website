## Hi — I'm Adam.

I’m running for Provo City Council, and I’d love to earn your vote.

Provo has been a central part of my life's story. I’ve lived here as a student, a working professional, and now as a husband and father. Over the past year, I’ve served on Provo’s Planning Commission, where I've worked to help guide the future of our community.

I’m excited to bring this experience to the Citywide 1 seat on the Provo City Council.

## Provo needs leaders who look forward.

Utah is changing quickly. As we navigate this change, we face important decisions about Provo's future. We need thoughtful answers to questions about growth, housing, finance, and our quality of life.

Where are we headed? Can we grow responsibly while protecting what makes Provo special? Can our city remain a welcoming place for families to put down roots?

I believe we can, and I'm eager to shape this vision together with you.

### Second, action.
