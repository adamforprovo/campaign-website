## Hi — I'm Adam.

I love our city and I'm proud to call it home.

Provo has shaped my life. I've lived here as a student, a working professional, and now as a husband and father.

Recently, I’ve served on Provo’s Planning Commission, helping guide development across the city.

I'm excited to bring this experience to the City Council Citywide 1 seat.

## Forward-thinking leadership.

Provo faces both opportunities and challenges. It's time to make thoughtful choices about where we're headed — and what kind of city we want to become.

I believe in our city's future. We can keep Provo welcoming to families, build a strong local economy, and embrace growth while protecting our city's character and quality of life.

Provo needs vision and direction. I'm committed to getting us there.

## Practical problem solving.

Provo residents deserve real solutions to their everyday struggles. 

Solving problems means diving into the issues. It means staying informed, thinking creatively, and putting in the work.

On the Planning Commission, I've tackled tough issues firsthand. As your City Council representative, I'll fight for housing affordability, safe streets, small business, and more.

## Transparency and communication.

Clear communication helps us address problems early. It means fewer surprises down the road.

Residents of Provo should know exactly how decisions are made and where their money is spent — especially around essential services and infrastructure.

Better transparency makes for a stronger city. I promise to listen, keep you informed, and make sure your voice is heard.

## A city that works for everyone.

Provo has a place for all of us: longtime residents, young families, students, and everyone in between. Let’s build a stronger future together.

I’d be honored to earn your vote this November!
