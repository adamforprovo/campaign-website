## Hi — I'm Adam.

I love our city and I'm proud to call it home.

Provo has shaped my life. I've lived here as a student, a working professional, and now as a husband and father.

Serving on Provo’s Planning Commission, I’ve worked to improve our neighborhoods — from housing affordability to safer streets and sidewalks.

I'm excited to bring this experience to the City Council Citywide 1 seat.

## Forward-thinking leadership.

Provo faces both opportunities and challenges. It's time to make thoughtful choices about where we're headed.

I believe in Provo's future. We can find ways to welcome families, strengthen our economy, and embrace growth while preserving our quality of life.

Provo needs vision and direction. I'm committed to getting us there.

## Practical problem solving.

Provo families deserve real solutions to their everyday struggles. 

Solving problems means diving into the issues. It means real effort, research, and creative thinking.

As your City Council representative, I’ll work to support local businesses, protect our outdoor spaces, improve active transportation and connectivity, and tackle the everyday issues that matter most to you.

## Transparency and communication.

Clear communication helps us address problems early. It means fewer surprises down the road.

Residents of Provo should know exactly how decisions are made and where their money is spent — especially around essential services and infrastructure.

Better transparency makes for a stronger city. I promise to listen, keep you informed, and make sure your voice is heard.

## A city that works for everyone.

Provo has a place for all of us: longtime residents, young families, students, and everyone in between.

Our city is strongest when we work together. Let’s build a better future for Provo.

I’d be honored to earn your vote this November!
