## Hi — I'm Adam.

I’m running for City Council because I care about Provo’s future.

Provo has been my home through many chapters of life. I’ve lived here as a student, a working professional, and now a husband and father. My wife and I both attended BYU, and we’re excited to be starting our family here.

Our city has so much to offer: education, recreation, career opportunities, and a welcoming, family-oriented community. These are the things that drew me here. I want to help carry them forward for the next generation.

## Forward-thinking leadership.

Provo’s future is full of potential, but we also face challenges. City revenues are declining, infrastructure costs are rising, and homeownership is slipping out of reach for many families.

We need to meet these challenges with thoughtful, practical solutions.

Serving on Provo’s Planning Commission, I’ve been an advocate for responsible economic policy, housing affordability, safe streets, and protecting the outdoors.

I believe local government works best when it supports personal freedom and individual rights. As a member of the City Council, I’ll continue to advocate for these principles.

## A city that works for everyone.

I love our city's ability to bring people together across generations. It's one of our greatest strengths.

Provo has a place for all of us: longtime residents, young families, students, and everyone in between. Let’s build a stronger future together.

I’d be honored to earn your vote this November!
