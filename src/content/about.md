# About Adam Shin

Provo has been my home through many chapters of life. It's been a place for education, work, family, and friendship.

I was born in Arizona and grew up in West Jordan. My parents both attended BYU and taught me a love of learning from an early age. As the oldest of five homeschooled kids, education was always a priority in our home.

Like many others, I first came to Provo as a student. I studied computer science at BYU and went on to work as a software developer for multiple local companies. Being part of Provo's young single social scene was a highlight of my time here; I made many friends and great memories during those years.

My wife Cheyenne and I met here in Provo. After spending a year out of state, we decided to move back to Utah to be closer to family. Provo was the only place that made sense for us. We love the city's unique character, family-oriented culture, and access to the outdoors. And we're excited to be starting our own family here.

When we came back, we wanted to get informed and involved. We started attending City Council meetings and other community events. Over the past year, I’ve had the opportunity to serve on Provo’s Planning Commission. It's been a great chance to learn and give back to the city.

I love walking, hiking, and spending time outside. Some of my favorite places in Provo are the River Parkway, the Rock Canyon Trailhead, and Hruska's Kolaches.
