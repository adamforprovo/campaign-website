## Economy and Finance

### Provo needs a strong economy and a sustainable budget.

We all want Provo to thrive for years to come. This means building a resilient economy and being honest about how we pay for city services.

**Right now, our budget is showing signs of stress.** Sales tax — our city's main source of income — is falling by millions of dollars each year. At the same time, infrastructure maintenance is becoming more expensive due to rising labor and material costs.

### Aging infrastructure is a form of hidden debt.

Roads, pipes, and equipment need constant maintenance. There are miles of missing sidewalks across the city. Many of our water lines are over 60 years old — some almost 100.

**According to our Water Master Plan, we've been underfunding our water system by $10 million a year.** Money that should have gone to maintenance has been spent elsewhere to make up for declining tax revenue.

This isn’t sustainable. Without a plan, we're passing an enormous bill on to the future.

### We're relying on big bets to balance the budget.

In recent years, we've leaned on large, ambitious projects to attract economic growth: the Epic Sports Park, the airport, big box retailers, and more.

Some of these have paid off. Others may take years just to return what we invested. This is a risky approach to rely on long-term.

### Long-term health comes from many small bets.

Growth is still possible — and necessary. But it has to be smarter.

Instead of putting our eggs in one basket, we can invest in incremental growth: neighborhood-scale infill, small businesses, and infrastructure that lasts. These small bets are less risky, more stable, and more likely to strengthen our tax base without adding strain.

A strong budget isn’t just balanced on paper — it reflects a plan. If we want to keep Provo thriving, we need to invest in what works, stop hiding costs, and build a city that can support itself for generations to come.


## Housing and Growth

### Provo should be a city where everyone can find a place to call home.

Housing is a key challenge for Provo. Families are being priced out of homeownership, while students and single renters are filling up homes in family neighborhoods.

**The root cause of our housing problem is scarcity.** To solve it, we need more homes on the market, of all kinds — including rentals and student housing in locations that make sense.

A more abundant housing market helps everyone. When students and working professionals can live closer to where they study and work, it relieves pressure on our neighborhoods and makes it easier for families to buy back in.

### To promote homeownership, we need to address affordability.

Utah was recently ranked the third-least affordable state to buy a home, behind only Hawaii and California. Those states are outliers. We shouldn't be.

**The average sale price for a house in Provo is $700,000.** If we want to keep homeownership within reach for families, we need to lower the barriers to building more affordable homes.

This includes gentle, neighborhood-scale options like small-lot homes, backyard cottages, and townhouses. These offer an entry point into the market and fit well into existing communities.

### Growth is coming. We choose whether to guide it.

Provo is an economic hub. We offer education, jobs, recreation, and real opportunities for upward mobility.

Utah County is projected to grow by over 160,000 people in the next decade. If we push this growth outside our city, we could see thousands of new commuters coming to Provo each day for work and school.

**We should focus new growth around employment centers, the university, and transit.** This will strengthen our tax base, reduce traffic, and offer a better quality of life for everyone in Provo.
