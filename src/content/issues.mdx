## Economy and Finance

### Provo needs a strong economy and a sustainable budget.

We all want Provo to thrive for years to come. This means building a resilient economy and planning ahead for our financial future.

**Right now, our budget is showing signs of stress.** Sales tax revenue — our city's main source of income — is falling by millions of dollars each year. At the same time, rising labor and material costs are driving up our expenses.

### Delayed maintenance is a form of hidden debt.

Roads, pipes, and facilities need constant maintenance. Our underground infrastructure is aging and needs replacement. Some of our water lines are almost 100 years old.

**According to a recent report, we're underfunding our water system by $10 million a year.** Instead of reinvesting this money in the system, we've been spending it elsewhere to make up for declining tax revenue.

Putting off maintenance saves money now, but it's not sustainable. Without a plan, we're passing an enormous bill on to the future.

### We're relying on big bets to balance the budget.

In recent years, we've leaned on large, ambitious projects to attract economic growth: the Epic Sports Park, the airport, big box retailers, and more.

**Big projects come with big risk.** Some of these bets have paid off, but others may take years to prove themselves. Once built, they’re hard to adapt — even if the return isn’t there.

Financially strong cities don’t rely on expensive projects to fix underlying budget problems. They make better use of what they already have.

### It's time to get the fundamentals right.

Instead of taking big risks, we should focus on incremental growth. We can build our tax base by supporting small businesses, infill projects, and mixed-use developments that don't require new infrastructure. 

**When we add value to places we’ve already built, we get a better return on our investment.** These kinds of small bets are how our city grew in the past. And they add up over time.

A strong budget isn’t just balanced on paper: it reflects a plan. We need to invest in what works, avoid hidden costs, and make sure our finances add up for future generations.


## Housing and Growth

### Provo should be a city where everyone can find a place to call home.

Housing is a key challenge for Provo. Families are being priced out of homeownership, while students and single renters fill up homes in family neighborhoods.

**The root cause of our housing problem is scarcity.** To solve it, we need more homes on the market, of all kinds — including rentals and student housing in locations where they're most needed.

A more abundant housing market helps everyone. When students and working professionals can live closer to where they study and work, it relieves pressure on our neighborhoods and makes it easier for families to buy back in.

### To promote homeownership, we need to address affordability.

Utah was recently ranked the third-least affordable state to buy a home, behind only Hawaii and California. Those states are outliers. We shouldn't be.

**The average sale price for a house in Provo is $700,000.** If we want to keep homeownership within reach for families, we need to lower the barriers to building more affordable homes.

This includes gentle, neighborhood-scale options like small-lot homes, backyard cottages, and townhouses. These offer an entry point into the market and fit well into existing communities.

### Growth is coming. We choose whether to guide it.

Provo is an economic hub. We offer education, jobs, recreation, and real opportunities for upward mobility.

Utah County is projected to grow by over 160,000 people in the next decade. If we push this growth outside our city, we could see thousands of new commuters coming to Provo each day for work and school.

**We should focus new growth around employment centers, the university, and transit.** This will strengthen our tax base, reduce traffic, and offer a better quality of life for everyone in Provo.
